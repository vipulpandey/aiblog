**CNN** ("Convolutional Neural Networks").

+ A non-specialist perspective
+ How Computer vision compares with human vision?
+ Why CNN is used for Computer Vision?
+ Concepts related to CNN
+ Demo of CNN in a basic example ( Cats vs Dogs)
+ Demo on Heroku Flask APP ( Gesture recognition in CNN )

+ A non-specialist perspective

Consider all the specialist working in the field of AI, meaning people with history of college degrees in ML courses or with experience in the field. This article doesn't assume any background. Think of yourself as the outlier of the field, and apply intuitive side of your brain to understand all these concepts.

+ How Computer vision compare with human vision ( A practical demo)

1). Arrangement of all images<br/>
2). Ask people  from live batch to classify the images.<br/>
3). Get the feedback data as training data<br/>
4). Train the model based on that.<br/>

## About the Dataset

+ Importing the data in csv format.
+ Importing the dataset in Image format ( Useful from practical use-case).

We will be using Keras (with TensorFlow as our backend) as the main package to create a simple neural network to predict, as accurately as we can, digits from handwritten images. In particular, we will be calling the Functional Model API of Keras, and creating a 4-layered and 5-layered neural network. Also, we will be experimenting with various optimizers: the plain vanilla Stochastic Gradient Descent optimizer and the Adam optimizer.

$$
f_{\alpha}(x) = \dfrac{x^2}{(x^2+x_{max}-x)^\alpha}
$$

Vestibulum erat wisi, condimentum sed, commodo vitae, ornare sit amet, wisi. Aenean fermentum, elit eget tincidunt condimentum, eros ipsum rutrum orci, sagittis tempus lacus enim ac dui.

$$
\alpha = \dfrac{t}{t_{max}}*\dfrac{\log(v)}{\log(v_{max})}
$$

Donec non enim in turpis pulvinar facilisis. Ut felis. Praesent dapibus, neque id cursus faucibus, tortor neque egestas augue, eu vulputate magna eros eu erat. Aliquam erat volutpat. Nam dui mi, tincidunt quis, accumsan porttitor, facilisis luctus, metus.

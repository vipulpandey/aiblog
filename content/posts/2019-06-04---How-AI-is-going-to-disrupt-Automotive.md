## Automotive change factors through time


### A to B on earth

- Before 21st Century
- In today's time

### Constituents of Self Driving Cars


# PAST

## Historical evolution of the field

### Timeline

These were the remains of the craftsmanship that went almost extinct in the times of Eric Gill.

# PRESENT

## What is Automotive & Mobility?

Technical Components of Car
Industry Overview
R&D => Raw Materials => Factories ( manufacturing of different parts ) => Car
Geographic conditions => Roads Construction 
Extraction of Fuel => Processing of Fuel => Distribution => Pump Stations
After Services


### Human Cenric version of Car Driving


### About Automotive & Mobility industry


### Top Level view of the Automotive industry

- Research & Development
- Fetching & Modifying Raw Material
- Factories (Manufacturing diff parts )
- Assembled Car

### Basic Infra Requirements
### Energy Requirements

# Functioning of Automotive - What it takes to drive a Car? 

## From Person's Perspective

### What it takes to drive a car?

(From a Person’s Perspective:) </br>
Start => Decide Destination => Using Senses to make Decisions => Stop </br>
Human Driver => Hands, Eyes, Ears, Legs, Brain => Conscious & Unconscious Decisions => Danger Assessment => Human error </br>
Functioning of Car ( from technical Perspective ) </br>
How engine and parts relate to each other </br>

#### Practical Demo

## From Technical Perspective

## Disruption on mobility/automotive industry


## How AI works on Automotive?

- Use care of industry leader
- Company: Google’s Waymo

### Car without Driver

Start => AI making decisions => end ( Demonstration of Car )
Parts of car in self-driving car
Demonstration of decision making
Demo of a startup from the field ( Google’s Waymo )
System Map of Waymo Technologies

### How AI makes this possible?

AI Decision making process
Software - Algorithms & models (DL)
Hardware - Robotics & Actuators
Talking Parts
Instance Demo of Car making decision


## What constitutes this industry?

# FUTURE

## What future of Automotive sector will look like ?

IOT for cars </br>
Artificially conscious system

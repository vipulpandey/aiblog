### Uber Advanced Technologies Center

### NVIDIA

Located in Santa Clara. Provides parallel processing, automotive grade high-performance hard- and software for autonomous driving. Its software platform provides base algorithms for autonomous driving out of the box. Has recently run a limited trial of using deep learning for lateral control of a self-driving car. The company may emerge as a key technology provider for the commercialization phase of self-driving cars.

### 1) Flux Auto ( http://fluxauto.xyz ):

**Self driving technologies for trucks**
Developing modular self driving technology for new and existing commercial vehicles, this Bangalore based autonomous truck driving startup converts/ transforms normal truck into a driverless truck. It aims to facilitate features like cruise control, lane keeping, collision avoidance, keeping a check on accidents, higher efficiency, amongst others in a much cost effective manner.

### 2) Hi Tech Robotic Systemz ( <https://www.hitechroboticsystemz.com> ) :

With a focus on enriching human life through smart robotics, Gurgaon headquartered Hi Tech Robotic Systemz is taking driverless vehicles in India a notch higher. Novus –Drive, a completely autonomous electric vehicle by the company was launched in the Auto Expo Motor show 2016 in India. This completely autonomous car lets the passengers set destination on the map, check details of destination drop off location, use snooze button to the stop vehicle, have Cloud Based Intelligence for a fleet management system and audio/visual alerts in case of emergencies. With a team size of 200+ across India, it offers core competencies in machine learning, sensor fusion, computer vision technologies, motion planning and control, amongst others.

### 3) ATI Motors ( <https://www.atimotors.com/> )

This Bangalore based startup has been founded by V. Vinay, Saurabh Chandra and Saad Nasser,a young engineer who has dropped out of school to become an entrepreneur. They are into designing autonomous electric cargo vehicles, with a major focus on customers outside India. With an interest to take the road ‘never taken before’, these founders came together to make new kind vehicle, which they call mule internally. This autonomous and all-electric car brings together the technology along with business opportunity within it.

### 4) Auro Robotics ( <http://auro.ai/>)

Run by IIT Kharagpur alumni, Auro Robotics is working on autonomous shuttle that is currently being running in the University of Santa Clara with multiple campus trials ongoing. With an aim of bringing self driving solutions into college campuses, corporate parks, residential communities, and other private-road settings, it is working on enabling end-to-end self-driving shuttles in these areas. The electric shuttle by the team relies heavily on LIDAR, a sensor technology that uses laser light for localization and spotting anomalies.

### 5) Netradyne ( <https://www.netradyne.com/>)

Netradyne provides cutting-edge technologies in Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning and Edge Computing to help reduce accidents by creating a new safe driving standard for commercial vehicles. Founded by Avneesh Agrawal, a former Qualcomm Inc. president for India and South Asia, and David Julian, a former principal engineer at the US-based chip-maker, Netradyne uses artificial intelligence to improve road and driver safety. Based out of Bengaluru and San Diego, US, Netradyne offers a powerful camera that analyses driving patterns and can help determine the cause of accident. The device called Driveri is the size of a soap bar and is attached to vehicle’s rear view mirror and rests on the inside of windscreen, pointing towards road. Its intelligent and situationally aware cameras connect the devices around the world.

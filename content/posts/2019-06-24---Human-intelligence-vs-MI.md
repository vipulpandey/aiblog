description: "One of the most effective algorithm that are used in Artificial Intelligent Systems is Deep Learning. In a sense, it is motivated by our assumption of How brain works!, hence the name Neural Networks. Here, we will be looking at more relatable comparison of HI( Human Intelligence) & MI( Machine Intelligence) Systems."

Before reading the article, let me introduce the concept of **"Intuitive Intelligence"**, which is what I assume should be part of your intelligence from where you should attend this and future articles. To make it short and clear, an agent observing a system, is said to possess "Intuitive Intelligence", if it's observation is not based on any assumption of the system ( Unbiased )  and preference of the observer ( emotionless ).

1). no background assumption </br>
2). non specialist use of the language

**Intelligence** is a relative concept. Here's the [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligence) definition - 

>Intelligence has been defined in many ways, including: the capacity for logic, understanding, self-awareness, learning, emotional knowledge, reasoning, planning, creativity, critical thinking, and problem solving. More generally, it can be described as the ability to perceive or infer information, and to retain it as knowledge to be applied towards adaptive behaviors within an environment or context.

## What is Human Intelligence?

+ Importing the data in csv format.
+ Importing the dataset in Image format ( Useful from practical use-case).

### Importing the data in csv format.
### Importing the dataset in Image format
## Preprocessing of Dataset



## What is Machine Intelligence?

+ Using Dense Network.
+ Using CNN and dense network.


## HI and MI as Input-Output System


## Comparison

## Use Case

```
$$
f_{\alpha}(x) = \dfrac{x^2}{(x^2+x_{max}-x)^\alpha}
$$

Vestibulum erat wisi, condimentum sed, commodo vitae, ornare sit amet, wisi. Aenean fermentum, elit eget tincidunt condimentum, eros ipsum rutrum orci, sagittis tempus lacus enim ac dui.

$$
\alpha = \dfrac{t}{t_{max}}*\dfrac{\log(v)}{\log(v_{max})}
$$

Donec non enim in turpis pulvinar facilisis. Ut felis. Praesent dapibus, neque id cursus faucibus, tortor neque egestas augue, eu vulputate magna eros eu erat. Aliquam erat volutpat. Nam dui mi, tincidunt quis, accumsan porttitor, facilisis luctus, metus.

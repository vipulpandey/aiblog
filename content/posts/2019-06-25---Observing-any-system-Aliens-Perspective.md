description: "One of the most effective algorithm that are used in Artificial Intelligent Systems is Deep Learning. In a sense, it is motivated by our assumption of How brain works!, hence the name Neural Networks. Here, we will be looking at more relatable comparison of HI( Human Intelligence) & MI( Machine Intelligence) Systems."

# Alien's Perspective

Imagine a alien instructed to come to earth and study something from the planet that fascinates it. And, it chose to study about "Rocket technologies". It will observe this system from an outsider's perspective.

Some obvious assumptions:

1). It doesn't know the language.
2). No idea about the concept of "emotions"
3). No biases in observation.
4). Minimize "specialist words" from the language


# Use Case - "Rocketry"

1) Understanding the system which is under observation
2) Way of Observing
- Direct Perception
- Experts Perception ( minus their biases)
- Final Takeaway

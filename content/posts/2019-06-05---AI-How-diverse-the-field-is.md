## Storyline

What is AI?
How diverse the field is?
How you can approach learning AI?
Skills required

Artificial intelligence (AI) is, essentially the singularity of all of the historical intelligence of humans based systems. True to its nature it has truly became an intersiciplinary field that takes motivation from philosophy, science, arts, engineering etc.

Artificial intelligence (AI) is wide-ranging branch of computer science concerned with building smart machines capable of performing tasks the typically require human intelligence. AI is an interdisciplinary science with multiple approaches, but advancements in machine learning and deep learning are creating a paradigm shift in virtually every sector of the tech industry.

AI can be classified into three different types of systems: analytical, human-inspired, and humanized artificial intelligence.

## Interdiciplinary nature of AI
**Artificial Intelligence** field draws upon computer science, information engineering, mathematics, psychology, linguistics, philosophy, and many other fields.

His major work, the Gutenberg Bible (also known as the 42-line Bible), has been acclaimed for its high aesthetic and technical quality.

## Practical Implementation of AI

 with the idea of printing. Legend has it that the idea came to him “like a ray of light”.

 Paris and is believed to have designed some of the first typefaces.

		<p>All that has been written to me about that marvelous man seen at Frankfurt is true. I have not seen complete Bibles but only a number of quires of various books of the Bible. The script was very neat and legible, not at all difficult to follow—your grace would be able to read it without effort, and indeed without glasses.</p>

In 1455 Gutenberg completed his 42-line Bible, known as the Gutenberg Bible. About 180 copies were printed, most on paper and some on vellum.

Meanwhile, the Fust–Schöffer shop was the first in Europe to bring out a book with the printer's name and date, the Mainz Psalter of August 1457, and while proudly proclaiming the mechanical process by which it had been produced, it made no mention of Gutenberg.

## Later Life

 It is believed he may have moved back to Mainz around this time, but this is not certain.

 with some variations due to miscasting and inking. However, the type used in Gutenberg's earliest work shows other variations.

However, most specialists regard the occasional overlapping of type as caused by paper movement over pieces of type of slightly unequal height.

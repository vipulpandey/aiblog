Artificial Intelligence ( AI ), is the most important technological achievement that we have achieved in the past century. It has been compared to the same effect, that electricity brought in our day to day life in the start of 19th century  ( Perhaps, more!!).

In simple terms Artificial intelligence is **“the effort to automate intellectual tasks normally performed by humans.”** Take any of the tasks that we do using our senses and body movements from  day-to-day human interactions like talking, walking, driving the car, performing delicate medical procedures, launching rockets etc,it may be mundane tasks to some of the most specialized and technical operations in CERN (particle accelerator), you can feel the presence of AI in a significant way!!

The AI field draws upon computer science, information engineering, mathematics, psychology, linguistics, philosophy, and many other fields, it's like all the human efforts in the past and aggregrated knowledge were leading up to this moment, when **"Singularity"** becomes a very reality not far away. While AI transforms the world beyond recognition, let's have a look at top 5 countries are taking the lead in the AI race.

The list is primarliy based on the perception of major publications, but it can be made more reliable if we a study that looks at the metrics such as:
***
1. Number of research published in AI.
2. Number of AI startups
3. Public awareness about the field.( Survey )
4. Number of trained AI professionals ( or ML experts, Data scientist etc )
5. National devised startegy ( Long term plan )
***

Let's have a look at top 5 countries leading (not necessarily in order):

+ ## China

China is already a world leader in AI research and has published more research papers on deep learning than other leading countries in the past few years. According to the Times Higher Education, in the period between 2011 and 2015, China published over 41,000 papers on AI. That's almost twice as much as the US number.

The government supports and stands behind the AI adoption. They want to become a global hub in AIby 2030. China so ahead in artificial intelligence and robotics in compare to other countries.

+ ## UNITED STATES OF AMERICA

There are a lot of private players in the USA who just want to lead the world. **Google, Microsoft, Tesla, Amazon, Facebook** are some of the most dominant forces not only in the USA but around the world. The USA is the most important player in the field of artificial intelligence and they recede almost 30$ billion in AI-based start-ups which is the highest in comparison to all the countries.
The very presence of USA based tech companies around the world is more than enough to show the prowess of USA in the AI field. The economic strength, tech ecosystems and talents avalaibility from all around the world, in USA, makes sure the leading position of the country.

+ ## JAPAN

> Recently , Softbank under their "vision fund" has pledged to invest $100 billion, in future technologies.

It's hard to ignore Japan when it comes to IT technolgies and robotics, the long presence of the Japan in the global business will be very helpful, for creating AI based ecosystem. Japan is the most developed country in Asia and it comes 3rd in terms of nominal GDP. The Japanese education system is one of the best in the world and their literacy rate is also above 95%. The Japanese government has planned to become fully integrated with artificial intelligence until 2030 because the Japanese population is aging slowly.

+ ## UNITED KINGDOM

> DeepMind Technologies Limited was founded in 2010, in Britain

The United Kingdom is a clear leader in AI in Europe, with 121 AI firms. In the year 2017 UK received more than double of FDI in compare to all European countries in their AI based start-ups. If we compare the UK with other European countries except for France and Germany, then they are really doing well in artificial intelligence.
Remember when Google's famous DeepMind beat Go's grandmasters ?  Well, DeepMind Technologies Limited was founded in 2010, in Britain. According to the Financial Times, DeepMind is today a world leader in AI. It employs 250 researchers, from mathematicians to neuroscientists.

+ ## GERMANY

> Berlin has become Europe’s leading hub for AI talent, and Germany is poised to become a leader in robotics, autonomous vehicles, and quantum computing.

Germany is one of the best and richest countries not only in Europe but in the entire world. They have lots of industries and their companies are also famous all over the world like Audi, Volkswagon, Airbus.  It has a good automation potential. In manufacturing, Germany and their companies already lead the world.
Germany, like China, also plans to become a leading hub for artificial intelligence.

+ ## ISRAEL

> Most Israeli entrepreneurs have strong military background which means that on average they have more hands-on experience working with AI, image processing, data science, etc. than entrepreneurs from other countries.   - Shuly Galili, cofounding partner at UpWest Labs.

The startup nation of Israel is targeting today’s hottest tech sector by deploying its expertise in cutting-edge data analysis, software and hardware engineering talent, and proven entrepreneurial skills. Israeli AI startups (using technologies such as machine learning, deep learning, computer vision, natural language processing, robotics, and speech recognition) have raised more than $4 Billion in last four years.
Israel not only good in cybersecurity but they also rule the world in artificial intelligence. Their robots and defence system are fully integrated with AI and automation. Israel is one of the most innovative countries in the world because they spend so much on research and development.
